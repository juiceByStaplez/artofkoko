# Next JS CMS Build

## Intent

This project is intended to create a framework for building server-side [React JS](https://github.com/reactjs) applications using [Next JS](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) with an [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) back end. The goal is to create a framework that is easy to use and configure, while providing the best possible user experience. Using this build should allow for building robust, custom applications that allows for search engine optimization, enhanced user experience, and seemless data integration.

## How to Run

`npm run dev` will kick start the development server. More scripts to come.
